## Searching Algorithms
### 1. Linear Search:
**Definition**: A simple algorithm which is used to find an element in a list by traversing or iterating by checking each element from beginning to the end until it's found. This is called as linear search because it traverses the list in a linear way, one element at a time. 

**Algorithm**:<br>
  _step 1_: Start from the first element of the list.<br>
  _step 2_: Compare the target value (k) with the current element.<br>
  _step 3_: If the target value matches the current element, return the index of the current element.<br>
  _step 4_: If the target value does not match, move to the next element.<br>
  _step 5_: Repeat steps 2-4 until the end of the list is reached.<br>
  _step 6_: If the target value is not found, return -1.<br>
